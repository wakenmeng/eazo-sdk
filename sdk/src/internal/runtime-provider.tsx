       * Wrap host children in a TWO-LAYER container:
       *
       *   .eazo-app-area              ← outer: containing block (transform)
       *     .eazo-app-area-scroller   ← inner: scroll container (overflow:auto)
       *       {host children}
       *
       * On plain web (where the banners actually render), `<html>` gets
       * the `eazo-host-web` class and both layers receive their active
       * styles:
       *   - outer: `position: fixed` + `transform: translateZ(0)` — the
       *     containing block for host's `position: fixed` descendants,
       *     positioned inside the inter-banner gap.
       *   - inner: `position: absolute; inset: 0; overflow: auto` — the
       *     actual scroll container. No `transform`, so it does NOT
       *     reparent fixed descendants; those resolve up to the outer
       *     and stay visually pinned during scroll.
       *
       * Why TWO layers, not one: a single element that combines
       * `transform: translateZ(0)` AND `overflow: auto` makes browsers
       * translate fixed descendants by the wrapper's scroll offset —
       * sticky CTAs end up scrolling with content instead of staying
       * pinned. Splitting the responsibilities fixes that.
       *
       * In mobile WebView / iframe the `eazo-host-web` class is never
       * added; both layers fall back to `display: contents`, which
       * REMOVES their boxes from layout entirely. Host children
       * participate in the grandparent's layout context as if the
       * wrapper elements didn't exist — no containing block, no scroll
       * container, no `window.scrollY` redirection, no `position: fixed`
       * reparenting. The wrapper is fully transparent to mobile/iframe
       * hosts; the React tree just carries two extra elements that
       * generate no boxes.
       *
       * BREAKING semantics on PLAIN WEB (also in CHANGELOG):
       *   - `window.scrollY` / `window` scroll events no longer reflect
       *     host content scrolling — read from `.eazo-app-area-scroller`.
       *   - `document.body { overflow: hidden }` no longer locks scroll;
       *     body-scroll-lock libraries must target the scroller.
       *   - Host modals at `position: fixed; inset: 0` are contained to
       *     the outer wrapper rather than covering the full viewport.
